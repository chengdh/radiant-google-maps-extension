Google Maps Extension

### Introduction

This extension allows users to create google maps and the other objects which make up an modern interactive google map.
It ONLY works with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases (and will for the forseeable future, depends on the spatial adapter).

This extension has been tested against Radiant 7.0 with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

###Requirements

You need to install a version >= 0.1.1 of the GeoRuby gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby/)
	gem install georuby

Currently the rake tasks assume you are using the standard vendor/extensions directory path, if no you will need to copy the assets manually
(Including the Javascript files from the ym4r_gm directory)

###Installation

After downloading the extension  you may have to rename the directory to "google_maps" then run the following commands

  rake radiant:extensions:google_maps:api <- THIS MUST BE RUN FIRST (Or manually copy and rename the API key file)
  rake production radiant:extensions:google_maps:migrate
  rake production radiant:extensions:google_maps:update

After this you will need to edit the config/gmaps_api_key.yml file with your Google Map API Key (Sample file has the key needed for localhost)

###Usage

Once installed a new tab will be visible called "Maps". Here you can setup your maps and child objects (Currently only GMarkers).
Marker content can use filters and Radius tags.

###Tags

Two tags are created by the extension

<r:google_map:header /> should be places in the <head> section of your page. This Radius tag creates the HTML JavaScript include tag with your API key necessary to run a google map.

<google_map:generate name="Map Name" div="Div ID" />

This can be placed anywhere in your document. The "name" attribute is the name of the map you wish to create and the "div" attribute is the html ID of the div you wish to generate the map in.

Note that this extension does not create or size the div. This is left to the user for easier placement and sizing of div using CSS.
