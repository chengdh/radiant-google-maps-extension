Google Maps Extension
---

This extension allows users to create google maps and the other objects which make up an interactive google map.

Currently very basic and not intended for production use.

###Requirements

You need to install a version >= 0.1.1 of the GeoRuby gem (http://rubyforge.org/projects/georuby/)
	gem install georuby

###Installation

After downloading the extension create a file called "gmaps_api_key.yml" in your RAILS_ROOT/config directory and edit it as required for your site. Then run

  rake production db:migrate:extensions
  rake production radiant:extensions:google_maps:update

###Usage

Once installed a new tab will be visible called "Maps". Here you can setup your maps and child objects

###Tags

Two tags are created by the extension

<r:google_map:header /> should be places in the <head> section of your page. This Radius tag creates the HTML JavaScript include tag with your API key necessary to run a google map.

<google_map:create name="Map Name" div="Div ID" />

This can be placed anywhere in your document. The "name" attribute is the name of the map you wish to create and the "div" attribute is the html ID of the div you wish to generate the map in.

Note that this extension does not create or size the div. This is left to the user for easier placement and sizing of div using CSS.
